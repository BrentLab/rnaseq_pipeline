_______________________________________

NOTES: this will place two images in the same snapshotDirectory. The second block (PERTURBED.png) will have two tracks, in this case a perturbed sample and a wt sample, in the view

other options can be added, eg maxPaneHeight, though using this option in the https://github.com/stevekm/IGV-snapshot-automator/blob/master/make_IGV_snapshots.py may have lead to cut offs of the genome in some of the images taken using that script. I have chosen to omit that line.

coloring can be added, but frustratingly those options are not clearly delineated in the IGV documentation. A discussion in the issues of the above repo here:

https://github.com/stevekm/IGV-snapshot-automator/issues/14

lead me to the IGV repo, which has a full list of the preferences:

https://github.com/igvteam/igv/blob/master/src/main/resources/org/broad/igv/prefs/preferences.tab

try:

SAM.COLOR_BY=TAG:XF to color reads by their assignment to a feature by htseq (this is the meaning of _with_annote in the bam file name currently). However, not sure if this works. SAM.COLOR_BY=READ_STRAND does according to the people on the issues link in the repo
